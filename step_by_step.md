### Step-by-Step Instructions for Running Curiocity Social Media SWOT Analysis

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
2. Navigate to the folder where you want the project.
3. Run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/curiocity_social_media_swot.git
cd curiocity_social_media_swot
```

#### Step 2: Install Python Requirements

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. In the terminal, run:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Wait until all packages install successfully.

#### Step 3: Install Node.js and npm (if not already installed)

1. Go to: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download and install the LTS version for your OS.
3. Confirm installation:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Step 4: Install TikTok-Scraper Globally

1. In terminal, run:

```sh
npm install -g tiktok-scraper
```

2. If you get permission errors, try:

```sh
sudo npm install -g tiktok-scraper
```

3. Confirm it works:

```sh
tiktok-scraper --help
```

#### Step 5: Configure Hashtag Input (Optional)

1. Open `config/hashtags_by_season.json` in a code editor.
2. Add or edit hashtags for "winter" and "summer".
3. Save the file.

#### Step 6: Scrape Instagram Data

1. In terminal, run:

```sh
bash collect_instagram.sh winter
bash collect_instagram.sh summer
```

2. Wait for each to complete. Output appears in `data/instagram/[season]/`

#### Step 7: Scrape TikTok Data

1. In terminal, run:

```sh
bash collect_tiktok.sh winter
bash collect_tiktok.sh summer
```

2. Files will appear in `data/tiktok/[season]/`

#### Step 8: Process Collected Data

1. In terminal, run:

```sh
python process_data.py
```

2. This creates filtered CSVs in `output/`, with keyword-matched content for both platforms and seasons.

#### Step 9: Generate SWOT Reports

1. In terminal, run:

```sh
python analyze_swot.py
```

2. Output files (`swot_winter.md`, `swot_summer.md`, and `all_mentions.csv`) will appear in the `output/` folder.

#### Step 10: Review and Use the Results

1. Open markdown SWOT files using any markdown viewer or text editor.
2. Open `all_mentions.csv` in Excel or Google Sheets for full post context.
3. Insert insights into your marketing strategy, content roadmap, or stakeholder presentations.

#### Step 11: Convert Data to a Queryable Database

1. Create a SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL database to house all `all_mentions.csv` data.
2. Use a script like:

```python
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('curiocity_insights.db')
df = pd.read_csv('output/all_mentions.csv')
df.to_sql('mentions', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

3. Enable text search capabilities:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE mentions_fts USING fts5(content);
INSERT INTO mentions_fts (rowid, content) SELECT rowid, comment FROM mentions;
```

4. Query by keyword, sentiment, platform, season, or location using SQL.
5. Build dashboards in Google Data Studio, Tableau, or Superset for visualization.

#### Recommendations for Strategic Impact Measurement

* Tag each mention with its likely conversion phase (awareness, interest, decision).
* Add UTM-tagged links in social content to track post-level conversions in GA4.
* Track bookings from UGC-referenced campaigns using custom links or promo codes.
* Integrate social data with booking logs from Curiocityâ€™s PMS to attribute revenue.
* Perform cohort analysis: compare periods with/without influencer campaigns or social UGC boosts.
* Use keyword frequency over time to monitor brand sentiment and experience appeal shifts.

#### Troubleshooting

* **TikTok-scraper fails:** Use Docker version or contact support.
* **Rate limits:** Wait and retry after 1-2 hours.
* **CSV is empty:** Ensure hashtags return active public posts.

You're now ready to deliver season-specific social media SWOT insights for Curiocity and turn that data into a continuously queryable, trackable, and measurable asset aligned with long-term growth.
